# Learning

ARM64 assembly is a simple assembly language. 
You might be able to start off with [a reference card](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse469/19wi/arm64.pdf).

ARM also provides [digital reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation) on the ARM64 (AArch64/ARMv8) architecture.

We hope you enjoy learning ARM assembly and working through the exercises.

This is a gateway to getting to know your phone or ARM64 based development hardware (the more recent Raspberry Pi models are an example).
