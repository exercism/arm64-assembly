# About

ARM64/AArch64 assembly is the 64-bit version of the ARM instruction set.
It is based on the ARMv7 instruction set, which is in turn loosely based off the legacy ARM Classic instruction sets.

This track involves programming in ARM64 assembly language, assembled and run on a cross-platform simulator.
